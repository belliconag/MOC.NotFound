Introduction
------------

Neos CMS package that loads a normal editable page for displaying a 404 error.

Compatible with Neos 2.x, 3.x

Supports multiple content dimensions with URI segments and empty segments for default dimensions.

Installation
------------
```composer require "moc/notfound:^3.0"```

Create a page with the URI segment "404" in the root of your site. If using content dimensions with URI segments,
ensure a page exists in all contexts or through fallbacks.

Alternatively set the following configuration in ``Settings.yaml``:

```yaml
Neos:
  Flow:
    error:
      exceptionHandler:
        renderingGroups:
          notFoundExceptions:
            options:
              variables:
                path: '404.html' # skip suffix if unset
```
